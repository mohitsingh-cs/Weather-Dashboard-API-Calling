# Weather Dashboard

A web application that uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch and display real-time weather information for any user-entered city.


## Features
- Fetches **current weather** and **5-day forecast** data using API calls.  
- Parses **JSON responses** and updates the interface dynamically with JavaScript.  
- Displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed with **weather condition icons**.  
- Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** — no backend required.  
- Fully responsive layout with a modern dark UI theme.
  

## How It Works
1. The user enters a city name.  
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.  
3. If the city exists, the API returns JSON data containing temperature, humidity, and weather details.  
4. The JavaScript then parses that data and updates the DOM to display the results.  
5. If the city is invalid, an error message is displayed.
